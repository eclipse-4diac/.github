Eclipse 4diac‚Ñ¢ has been started 2007 as an open source project fostering the further development of IEC 61499 for its use in distributed Industrial Process Measurement and Control Systems (IPMCS) and to support research in that area. 
From the beginning, it has provided everything that is necessary to program and execute IEC 61499-based control programs for distributed IPMCS.

## Community 

The Eclipse 4diac is an Eclipse Community project so it obeys governance rules described in the [Eclipse Development Process](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/) to guarantee meritocracry, diversity, vendor-neutrality and business-friendliness.

Please bear in mind that this project is almost entirely developed by volunteers and is not a product you contracted for. As a result, the contributors may not be able to look into some support requests. 
As per Eclipse Development Process, the committers are committed to review incoming code contributions though. 
If you do not provide the fix/implementation yourself (or pay someone to do it for you), the bug might never get fixed. 
If it is a serious bug, other people than you might care enough to provide a fix. 
As a consequence of all that, the only sure way to ensure some issue gets fixed or some feature gets implemented is that you contribute it yourself and convince some contributor that the change you submit is in the best interest of the project.

As you contribute more and more, you will eventually get nominated as a committer on the project.
